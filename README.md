# Hi there 👋, I’m Davide!  

**Java developer | DevOps & AI explorer | Amateur chef**  

 I’m a software engineer who thrives on learning and turning new ideas into reality. When I step away from the keyboard, you’ll often find me in the kitchen experimenting with flavors, aiming for that perfect “wow” moment when someone tastes my creations. And if I’m not cooking or coding, I’m usually immersed in a board, card or story driven video-game (modding Skyrim for the 300th time also) or just chilling with my girlfriend and friends .
